I am currently a PhD student in the Department of Statistics at KAUST (King Abdullah University of Science and Technology), where I am part of the [Bayesian Deep Learning group](https://bdl.kaust.edu.sa/) led by [Prof. Maurizio Filippone](https://mauriziofilippone.github.io/).

My research interests broadly lie in probabilistic machine learning, with a focus on Bayesian deep learning, generative models, uncertainty quantification, and scalable inference. I am particularly motivated by understanding and improving the reliability of modern machine learning systems, and by studying how probabilistic reasoning can enhance representation learning and model robustness.

Previously, I earned a double master’s degree in Computer Engineering (AI & Data Analytics track) from Politecnico di Torino, Italy and Data Science from EURECOM, France. During my studies, I gained industrial and academic experience as an R&D intern at Alten Labs Paris, working on autonomous driving and as a research intern at EURECOM.

My broader aim is to develop principled and efficient probabilistic learning methods that scale to modern data and model sizes, while providing meaningful uncertainty estimates and enhanced interpretability.
